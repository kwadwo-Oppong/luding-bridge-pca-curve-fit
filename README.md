# luding-bridge-pca-curve-fit
Parametric curve modeling of pedestrian movement on the Luding Suspension Bridge using PCA and polynomial fitting in 3D space. Includes data visualization, dimensionality reduction, projection, and reconstruction in the original coordinate system.
This project analyzes the movement of pedestrians across the Luding Suspension Bridge in China. Using a dataset of 3D coordinates, we model the bridge's catenary curve through dimensionality reduction and curve fitting techniques in $R^3$
